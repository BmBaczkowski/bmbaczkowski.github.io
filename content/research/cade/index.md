I was incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to work with [Dr. Cade McCall](https://www.lifelikelab.science/cade-mccall) and his team on designing an immersive virtual environment -- **Room101** -- to study the waxing and waning of threats in an unpredictable environment.  

This was my first (and possibly best) research internship where I learned Python programming.  

**Thank you, Cade!!!** I learned so much from you!  



##### Abstract 


> Room 101 is an immersive virtual environment designed that we developed to study the waxing and waning of threats in an unpredictable environment. Participants encounter a series of threats including startling events (e.g., explosions) as well as more prolonged threats (e.g., spiders, a collapsing floor).  Using a head-mounted display, participants wander around the room as these events emerge. Meanwhile we measure their peripheral physiological responses. Afterwards, we play a video recording of the participant's experience while they provide a continuous rating of their subjective arousal. -- *sourced from* [LifeLikeLab](https://www.lifelikelab.science/room101)
