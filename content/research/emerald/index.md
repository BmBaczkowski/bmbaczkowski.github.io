summary: |
    Recognising dangerous situations is crucial for regulating defensive behaviours that are tailored to the imminence of potential harm. Past life-threatening situations that have been overcome teach us about what might pose a risk of harm in the future. However, when learned or similar threats are not immediately perceptible in the current environment, the risk of harm, even if remote, may still exist. In such cases, it must be inferred rather than directly derived from a past aversive experience. How do individuals assess risk in such circumstances?

#### Abstract

To protect from danger, individuals learn to recognise threats through aversive experiences, as described by Pavlovian threat conditioning. However, Pavlovian threat memory alone is insuﬀicient to gauge danger when previously encountered threats are absent. Here, we show that, to infer risk, individuals rely on their pre-existing knowledge of environmental relations among multiple cues that were never experienced in an aversive context. We trained participants to associate pairs of novel images that together formed an abstract linear knowledge structure. The next day, the image anchored at one end of the structure acquired Pavlovian threat memory. When later exposed to the remaining images under the risk of a mild electric shock, participants showed defensive responses, both in self-reported and physiological measures, that scaled with the associative distance between the neutral and threatening cues. Our findings suggest that individuals prepare for anticipated harm according to a memory structure built from separate learning experiences.
