<!--     Pavlovian threat conditioning is a fundamental process of how we learn about threats. However, learning from first-hand exposure to danger inevitably involves a risk of harm and is largely limited to detecting known (or similar) threats. To predict and detect novel threats, Pavlovian threat memory needs to be complemented by other learning systems that operate mainly in safety and represent threats and the structure of our environment in rapid episodic memory, relational (map-like) memory, and conceptual knowledge. Complementary memories of threats and the structure of our environment may also result from communication with and observation of others, which largely spares exposure to danger. Building knowledge about the world beyond first-hand Pavlovian threat conditioning allows danger to be inferred rather than learned, which crucially minimizes the risk of harm to the organism. -->

#### Abstract

Learning about threats is crucial for survival and fundamentally rests upon Pavlovian conditioning. However, Pavlovian threat learning is largely limited to detecting known (or similar) threats and involves first-hand exposure to danger, which inevitably poses a risk of harm. We discuss how individuals leverage a rich repertoire of mnemonic processes that operate largely in safety and significantly expand our ability to recognize danger beyond Pavlovian threat associations. These processes result in complementary memories â€“ acquired individually or through social interactions â€“ that represent potential threats and the relational structure of our environment. The interplay between these memories allows danger to be inferred rather than directly learned, thereby flexibly protecting us from potential harm in novel situations despite minimal prior aversive experience.
